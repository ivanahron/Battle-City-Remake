## **Objective**  
The main goal is to protect your Castle and fight an army of Crossbow Carriages that seeks to destroy it! The enemies have outnumbered you but don't falter, you have your surroundings to utilize as well as power ups that can make you stronger! Do it for the kingdom!!  

## **Movement Controls**  
You can move your crossbow carriage by pressing or holding the keys W, A, S, or D. You can shoot arrows by pressing the spacebar.  
  
**W to move North  
A to move West  
S to move South  
D to move East  
SPACEBAR to shoot**  
  
You have the option to press the button to move once at a time or hold it for a continuous movement. Take note that the speed is limited and you can only move one direction at a time!  
  
## **Other Controls**  
**CTRL + S** to start the game  
**CTRL + R** to restart to level 1  
  
## **Crossbow Carriages and Power-ups**  
  
### *Your Crossbow Carriage*  
![Player](https://github.com/ivanahron/Battle-City-Remake/blob/main/Images/Player.png)   
  
### *Arrow it shoots*  
![Arrow it shoots](https://github.com/ivanahron/Battle-City-Remake/blob/main/Images/Player%20Regular%20Arrow.png)  
  
You'll initially have 2 lives and the the regular arrow that it shoots deals 1 damage to walls that are possible to destroy. Any type of arrow will destroy all types of tank in just one hit.  
  
*Note that your arrow can kill yourself as it bounces on the grid boundaries.*  
  
*There are 2 power ups ingame that can make your crossbow carriage stronger.*  
  
### *Attack Boost*

### *Magic Arrow*  
![Magic Arrow](https://github.com/ivanahron/Battle-City-Remake/blob/main/Images/Player%20Magic%20Arrow.png)  
  
Picking up an *Attack Boost* will turn the arrow that your crossbow carriage shoots in a *Magic Arrow*. This will take the damage of your arrow to 3 for 10 seconds, making everything it touches vanished to thin air!  
  
### *Defense Boost*

### *Evolved Crossbow Carriage*  
![Evolved Crossbow Carriage](https://github.com/ivanahron/Battle-City-Remake/blob/main/Images/Powered%20Up%20Player.png)  
  
Picking up a *Defense Boost* will evolve your crossbow carriage that makes it **Invulnerable**. This effect only lasts for 10 seconds and is not stackable so make sure to take advantage of it!  
  
*Note that powerups may persist on the next level as long as the duration is not yet over, but it will be gone if your crossbow carriage gets destroyed.*  
  
## **Type of Enemies**  
  
### *Regular Enemy*

![Arrow it shoots](https://github.com/ivanahron/Battle-City-Remake/blob/main/Images/Enemy%20Magic%20Arrow.png)  
  
Evolved Crossbow Carriages have stronger arrows than the regular ones. It takes 3 hits of your regular arrow to destroy a single one, so don't take them head on! However, don't worry since they may only appear at rounds 2 and above of each level!  
  
## **Type of Walls**  
  
### **Brick Wall**  
![Brick Wall](https://github.com/ivanahron/Battle-City-Remake/blob/main/Images/Brick%20Wall.png)  
  
*Brick Walls are not walkable but are destroyable. It takes 3 hits from regular arrows and 1 hit from Magic Arrow before it gets destroyed. Uppong getting destroyed, it will become an empty walkable cell.*  
  
### **Cracked Brick Wall**  
![Cracked Brick Wall](https://github.com/ivanahron/Battle-City-Remake/blob/main/Images/Cracked%20Brick%20wall.png)  
  
*Cracked Brick Walls are just weaker version of Brick Walls. It only takes 1 hit from any arrow to be destroyed and become and empty walkable cell.*  
  
### **Iron Wall**

### **Forest**  
![Forest](https://github.com/ivanahron/Battle-City-Remake/blob/main/Images/Forest.png)  
  
*Forests are walkable but not destroyable. Walkable in a sense that crossbow carriages can walk undeneath them, bullets can also pass through them the same way.*  
  
### **Mirrors**  
![Mirrors](https://github.com/ivanahron/Battle-City-Remake/blob/main/Images/Mirror%201.png) ![](https://github.com/ivanahron/Battle-City-Remake/blob/main/Images/Mirror%202.png)

### **Castle**  
![](https://github.com/ivanahron/Battle-City-Remake/blob/main/Images/Castle%20(Home).png)  
  
*The Castle is similar to the Home of Battle City. If the Castle gets destroyed under any circumstance, the game will be over for the player.*
